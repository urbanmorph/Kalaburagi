## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Challenge
Kalaburagi ranks **30/30** among Karnataka districts in per capita income (₹1.46 lakh estimated 2025-26 vs. state average ₹2.85 lakh). This 49% gap represents ₹4,850 crore in unrealized annual economic activity. The district faces structural constraints:

- **86.6% rainfed agriculture** (vs. state average 55% irrigated)
- **28% borewell failure rate** (water scarcity crisis)
- **43% of Bangalore construction workers** from Kalaburagi (poverty-induced migration)
- **Informal economy dominance** (70% of activity unmeasured)
- **Infrastructure deficit** (rank 26/30 in irrigation, 22/30 in industry)

### The Opportunity
Kalaburagi has latent strengths that targeted investment can unlock:

- **India's largest pulse producer** (500+ dal mills, GI-tagged Tur Dal)
- **High agricultural workforce** (58.46% vs. state 33%)
- **Young population** (66.2% rural, trainable workforce)
- **Strategic location** (NH-50, 200-250km to Hyderabad aerospace/pharma clusters)
- **Natural resources** (2.5-4 billion MT limestone reserves, 200-400 year supply)
- **Government commitment** (₹20,150 crore investment committed)
- **Policy momentum** (PM MITRA ₹390cr approved Dec 2024)

### The Approach
This framework operationalizes a **₹20,150 crore, 8-year investment program (2026-2034)** across three phases:

1. **Phase 1 (Years 1-3, 2026-2029): Foundation** - ₹3,980 cr → Water, power, roads, first industries
2. **Phase 2 (Years 4-6, 2029-2032): Activation** - ₹7,125 cr → Processing, FPOs, skills, MSMEs, industries scale-up
3. **Phase 3 (Years 7-8, 2032-2034): Scale** - ₹6,845 cr → Strategic industries, urban infra, consolidation

**Investment Breakdown:**
- **Core programs:** ₹17,700 crore (agriculture, MSMEs, FPOs, infrastructure)
- **Alternate industries:** ₹2,450 crore (garments, limestone, aerospace, pharma)

**Targets (2034):**
- **Rank:** 15/30 (from 30/30)
- **Per capita income:** ₹2.50 lakh (from ₹1.46 lakh, 71% increase)
- **Jobs created:** 156,700 total
  - Core programs: 100,000 jobs (agro-processing 35K, MSMEs 25K, services 20K, construction 15K, government 5K)
  - Alternate industries: 56,700 jobs (garments 26K, limestone 12K, aerospace 12K, pharma 6.7K)
- **GDDP contribution from industries:** ₹1,508 crore (4.3% of target)

### The Dashboard's Role
The dashboard serves as the **single source of truth** for:

- **Real-time progress tracking** (100+ indicators across 3 phases, including 4 industries)
- **Resource allocation decisions** (₹20,150 cr across 100+ schemes)
- **Stakeholder alignment** (District Collector to Gram Panchayat)
- **Course correction triggers** (alerts when targets miss by >20%)
- **Accountability mechanism** (public transparency, performance reviews)
- **Critical actions monitoring** (7 red/yellow alerts including 4 industries actions)

This document provides the **implementation blueprint** for executing this vision while maintaining dashboard integrity.

## PART 1: STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK

### 1.1 Theory of Change

**Problem Statement:**  
Kalaburagi's low per capita income (rank 30/30) stems from three interlinked deficits:

```
Agricultural Stagnation â†’ Low Farm Income â†’ Out-migration
      â†“                         â†“                  â†“
  (88% rainfed)         (â‚¹50k/yr/farmer)    (43% to Bangalore)
      â†“                         â†“                  â†“
Water Infrastructure â†’ Value Addition â†’ Non-Farm Employment
  Deficit (11% irr.)    Deficit (300    Deficit (6,400 jobs
                        basic mills)     in formal sector)
```

**Change Hypothesis:**

*IF* we invest â‚¹15,500 crore systematically across water security (20%), rural connectivity (7%), power (5%), agro-processing (15%), FPOs (2%), skills (4%), and MSMEs (16%),

*AND* we execute through structured project management with monthly dashboard monitoring,

*THEN* we will:
1. Increase irrigation from 11.3% â†’ 25% (Phase 1-2)
2. Add â‚¹1,420 cr in agro-processing value (Phase 2)
3. Create 100,000 non-farm jobs (Phase 2-3)
4. Raise per capita income from â‚¹1.25L â†’ â‚¹2.10L (67% increase)
5. Improve district rank from 30 â†’ 15 by 2030

*BECAUSE* water security enables double-cropping and horticulture, which increases raw material availability for processing, which creates factory jobs and service sector opportunities, which raises household incomes and reduces migration.

**Critical Assumptions (Must Be Monitored):**
1. Groundwater recharge matches extraction (borewells remain viable)
2. Power supply improves to 18 hours for agriculture (from 8-12 hours)
3. Dal mills achieve 80% capacity utilization (from current 60%)
4. FPOs achieve â‚¹1,500 cr annual turnover (aggregation works)
5. 30% of migrants return due to local job creation
6. State/Central schemes continue with minimal policy changes
7. Bank CD ratio improves from 69% â†’ 85% (credit access)

### 1.2 Target-Setting Methodology

#### **Primary Outcome: Per Capita Income**

**Baseline (2021-22):** â‚¹1,24,998 (official, Economic Survey Karnataka)  
**Current Estimate (2023-24):** â‚¹1,30,000 - 1,40,000 (proxy indicators)  
**Target (2029-30):** â‚¹2,10,000

**Calculation Method:**
```
Per Capita Income = GDDP / Population

Current: â‚¹40,500 cr / 25.66 lakh = â‚¹1.58 lakh (2022-23 GDDP-based)

Target Pathway:
Year 1-2: â‚¹1.25L â†’ â‚¹1.45L (+16%, foundation investments)
Year 3-5: â‚¹1.45L â†’ â‚¹1.80L (+24%, activation of processing)
Year 6-8: â‚¹1.80L â†’ â‚¹2.10L (+17%, scale & diversification)

Required GDDP Growth: 8.5% CAGR (vs. current 6.2%)
Required Population Growth: 1.0% (current demographic trend)
```

**Validation Against Comparable Districts:**

| District | 2021-22 Per Capita | Strategy | Timeline |
|----------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| Vijayapura | â‚¹1,31,474 | Agro-processing | Rank 27â†’18 (8 years) |
| Yadgir | â‚¹1,11,733 | Irrigation focus | Rank 29â†’23 (6 years) |
| **Kalaburagi** | â‚¹1,24,998 | Integrated approach | **Rank 30â†’15 (8 years)** |
| Raichur | â‚¹1,47,282 | Mining + agri | Rank 24â†’17 (7 years) |

**Benchmark:** Ballari moved from rank 19 â†’ 8 in 10 years (â‚¹1.8L â†’ â‚¹3.2L) due to mining boom. Kalaburagi's target is conservative by comparison.

#### **Intermediate Targets: Job Creation**

**Target:** 156,700 non-farm jobs by 2034

**Core Programs:** 100,000 jobs
**Alternate Industries:** 56,700 jobs

**Core Programs Sectoral Breakdown:**
```
Agro-processing:   35,000 jobs (500+ dal mills upgradation)
MSMEs:             25,000 jobs (2,500 units @ 10 jobs/unit)
Services:          20,000 jobs (logistics, retail, hospitality)
Construction:      15,000 jobs (infrastructure projects)
Government:         5,000 jobs (expansion of departments)
```

**Alternate Industries Breakdown:**

**Step 2: Budget Allocation (Month 2)**
- Approach Central scheme: KUSUM (PM-KUSUM Component B)
- State budget: â‚¹200 cr allocation in FY budget
- NABARD refinance: â‚¹150 cr (for farmer loans)
- Farmer contribution: â‚¹120 cr (20% average across categories)
- Total arranged: â‚¹573 cr âœ“

**Step 3: Beneficiary Selection (Month 3-4)**
- Open online applications (agriculture portal)
- Priority scoring: SC/ST (40 points), small farmer (30), drought-prone area (30)
- District committee approves list (1,910 beneficiaries)
- Publish on website (transparency)

**Step 4: Subsidy Release Mechanism (Month 5 onwards)**
- Farmer pays 10-20% upfront to vendor
- Vendor installs pump, submits commissioning certificate
- Joint inspection: Agriculture Dept + Energy Dept (geo-tagged photo)
- Subsidy released: Directly to vendor within 15 days (cashless transaction)
- Farmer pays balance installments to vendor (or takes NABARD loan)

**Step 5: Verification & Monitoring (Ongoing)**
- Monthly: Dashboard updated (applied, approved, installed, operational)
- Quarterly: Sample field verification (10% random checks)
- Annual: Beneficiary satisfaction survey
- Warranty enforcement: Vendor must rectify defects within 48 hours (penalty: blacklisting)

**Red Flags (Automatic Alerts):**
- If subsidy release >60 days post-installation (grievance escalated to DC)
- If operational pumps <80% of installed (quality issue, stop new sanctions)
- If budget utilization <70% by Q3 (slow pace, need acceleration)

### 2.4 Alternate Industries Execution Frameworks

**Strategic Rationale:**

Beyond the core agro-processing focus (dal mills), Kalaburagi has identified **4 alternate industrial opportunities** that leverage:
1. **Strategic location:** 200-250km from Hyderabad's aerospace and pharma clusters
2. **Natural resources:** 2.5-4 billion MT limestone reserves
3. **Labor availability:** Young, trainable workforce + return migrants
4. **Policy support:** PM MITRA (₹390cr approved), industrial subsidies

**Total Contribution:**
- Investment: ₹2,450 crore (13.8% additional to ₹17,700 cr core budget)
- Jobs: 56,700 direct + 31,700 indirect = 88,400 total
- GDDP: ₹1,242 crore annually (3.58% of 2034 target)
- Timeline: Staggered across all 3 phases to avoid overwhelming PMU capacity

**Integration with Core Framework:**
These industries are **NOT standalone**. They leverage Phase 1 infrastructure:
- 24×7 industrial power feeders (₹50 MVA substation by Q4 2027)
- NH-50 highway connectivity

- Photos: Before, during, after (minimum 3 per project)
- Beneficiary details: Name, Aadhaar, contact (for verification)
- Issues/delays: Text field (e.g., "Land dispute with neighbor")

*2. Beneficiary Satisfaction Survey (Monthly, Sample 10%)*

Questions (5-point scale: Very Dissatisfied to Very Satisfied):
- Quality of work: Is the borewell/equipment functioning properly?
- Timeliness: Was the project completed as per promised schedule?
- Staff behavior: Were officials helpful and respectful?
- Documentation: Was the paperwork clear and hassle-free?
- Impact: Has your income/productivity improved? (Yes/No/Too Early)

Open-ended: "What can be improved?" (voice recording option)

*3. Market Data Collection Form (Weekly)*

For APMC/markets:
- Commodity arrival volumes (Tur, Chana, Moong - quintals)
- Modal price (most common price for the day)
- Number of traders present
- Observations: Any distress sales? Quality issues? Transport problems?

*4. Infrastructure Verification Checklist (As Needed)*

Used when dashboard shows "Completed" but field verification pending:
- Physical presence: Is the asset there? (Yes/No/Partially)
- Functional status: Is it working? (Yes/No/Needs Repair)
- Beneficiary awareness: Does farmer know how to use it? (Yes/No)
- Maintenance: Is there a plan for upkeep? (Yes/No/Unclear)
- Photo evidence: 360-degree view, close-up of nameplate/serial number

**Quality Assurance:**

*Daily:* Mobile app flags incomplete entries (e.g., photo missing, GPS not captured)  
*Weekly:* Data Management Officer reviews 100% of submissions for logical errors  
*Monthly:* M&E Specialist conducts random field re-verification (5% of DCO's work)  
*Quarterly:* External audit by independent agency (10% sample across all DCOs)  

**Performance Metrics for DCOs:**

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Data completeness | >95% | % of mandatory fields filled |
| Timeliness | >90% | % of weekly submissions on time (Saturday 5 PM deadline) |
| Accuracy | >85% | % of re-verified data matching DCO's reports |
| Beneficiary coverage | 100% | Every beneficiary interviewed at least once within 3 months |

## PART 4: MONITORING & COURSE CORRECTION

### 4.1 Performance Monitoring Framework

#### **Three-Level Monitoring Cascade**

**Level 1: Real-Time Monitoring (Dashboard + Automated Alerts)**

*Purpose:* Catch deviations early, enable immediate corrective action

*Mechanism:*
- Dashboard updates daily (for high-confidence indicators)
- Automated alerts triggered if:
  - Physical progress <80% of time-elapsed (e.g., Month 6, but only 40% work done)
  - Budget utilization <70% by Q3 (surrender risk)
  - Beneficiary satisfaction <3/5 for any scheme (quality issue)
  - Red alerts: >20% deviation from target

*Recipient:* PMU (Data Management Officer sees all alerts daily at 9 AM)

*Action Protocol:*
- PMU investigates within 24 hours (calls department, DCO, contractor)
- Root cause documented (e.g., contractor shortage, weather delay, beneficiary reluctance)
- Solution proposed (e.g., empanel 2 more contractors, extend deadline by 1 month)
- Escalated to District Collector if not resolved in 1 week

**Level 2: Periodic Reviews (Weekly/Monthly Meetings)**

*Weekly PMU Review (Mondays, 10 AM, 2 hours):*
- Participants: 5 PMU core members + 2-3 department INOs (rotating)
- Agenda:
  1. Dashboard overview (5 mins): Phase progress, budget, alerts

  3. Department updates (10 mins each): Successes, challenges
  4. Financing status (10 mins): Releases, bottlenecks
  5. Action items assignment (5 mins): Who does what by when

*Monthly Departmental Review (Last Wednesday, half-day):*
- Morning session: 5-6 departments present (15 mins each)
- Structure: Targets â†’ Achievements â†’ Challenges â†’ Asks (resources/support)
- Afternoon session: Cross-departmental coordination
  - Example: Agriculture needs power connections for borewells â†’ Energy Dept prioritizes
- Output: Minutes with action points, deadlines, responsible persons

*Monthly Block Review (Last Friday, video conference):*
- Each of 11 BDOs presents block dashboard (10 mins)
- Peer comparison: Best-performing block shares tips
- Common challenges aggregated (e.g., 7 blocks report contractor delays â†’ Systemic issue, PMU addresses with contractor association)
- Recognition: "Block of the Month" announced (â‚¹2 lakh grant for GP-level projects)

**Level 3: Institutional Reviews (Quarterly/Annual)**

*Quarterly Steering Committee (January, April, July, October):*
- Duration: Half-day
- Venue: Kalaburagi Collectorate, open to media
- Agenda:
  1. Dashboard presentation (30 mins): PMU Project Director presents

- Next year's action plan approved

### 4.2 Course Correction Protocols

#### **Trigger-Based Intervention Matrix**

| Deviation Level | Example | Response Time | Authority | Action |
|-----------------|---------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| **Minor (<10%)** | Project 5% behind schedule | 1 week | PMU + Dept | Informal nudge, offer support |
| **Moderate (10-20%)** | Scheme 15% underspent by Q2 | 2 weeks | Dept Head + BDO | Formal review, action plan, 2-week follow-up |
| **Major (20-30%)** | Phase target at 50% by Month 8 (expected 65%) | 1 month | Collector + PMU | Root cause analysis, restructure if needed |
| **Critical (>30%)** | Scheme completely stalled | Immediate | Steering Committee | Emergency meeting, consider scheme cancellation/redesign |

#### **Course Correction Case Studies (Hypothetical Scenarios)**

**Scenario 1: Solar Pump Installation 40% Behind Schedule**

*Situation (Month 9):*
- Target: 1,150 pumps (60% of 1,910)
- Actual: 450 pumps (24%)
- Deviation: -36% (CRITICAL)

*Dashboard Alert:* ðŸ”´ Red flag triggered on Month 9 Monday morning

*Investigation (Week 1):*
- PMU calls Energy Dept INO: "Why so slow?"
- INO: "Only 3 vendors empaneled, they can't keep up with demand"
- PMU verifies: Checks vendor contracts, confirms capacity constraint

*Root Cause:*
- Empanelment criteria too strict (only MNRE-certified, eliminated many local suppliers)
- Subsidy release process slow (taking 45 days instead of promised 15 days)

*Corrective Actions (Week 2):*
1. **Immediate (24 hours):**
   - District Collector issues order: Relax criteria to include Karnataka Solar Policy-certified vendors (adds 12 more vendors)
   - Finance Department: Fast-track subsidy releases, target 7-day turnaround

2. **Short-term (2 weeks):**
   - PMU conducts vendor orientation camp (20 vendors attend)
   - Publish revised subsidy guidelines (clearer documentation requirements)
   - Set up dedicated helpline for vendors (resolve queries within 24 hours)

3. **Medium-term (1 month):**
   - Aggressive farmer mobilization: Village-level awareness camps by KVKs
   - Simplify application: Move to single-page form + Aadhaar verification
   - Performance incentive for vendors: â‚¹5,000 bonus per pump if installed within 30 days

*Monitoring (Ongoing):*
- Weekly progress reviews for next 3 months
- Target revised: 1,500 pumps by Month 18 (from original 1,910)
- Remaining 410 pumps: Spill over to Year 3 budget

*Outcome (Month 18):*
- Achieved: 1,480 pumps (97% of revised target)
- Lessons learned: Vendor capacity must be assessed before setting targets, subsidy process must be piloted before scaling

**Scenario 2: Dal Mill Upgradation - Low Application Rate**

*Situation (Year 3, Q2):*
- Target: 150 mills to apply by Q2
- Actual: 45 mills applied
- Deviation: -70% (CRITICAL)

*Investigation:*
- Industries Dept conducts phone survey of 100 mill owners
- Findings:
  - 40% say: "20% equity contribution too high, don't have cash"
  - 30% say: "Bank loan process too complicated, gave up"
  - 20% say: "Doubt whether upgraded mill will be profitable"
  - 10% say: "Happy with current setup, don't see need to upgrade"

*Root Cause:*
- Scheme design didn't adequately consider mill owners' financial constraints
- Lack of awareness about benefits (ROI calculation never communicated)

*Corrective Actions:*

1. **Equity Barrier:**
   - Partner with SIDBI: Offer collateral-free loans for 20% equity (8% interest, 5-year repayment)
   - Allow staggered equity: Pay 10% upfront, 10% after 1 year of operations

2. **Loan Process:**
   - Set up "Mill Upgradation Facilitation Desk" at Industries Office
   - Hire 2 CMA consultants to prepare project reports for mill owners (free service)
   - Bank coordination: Designate nodal officers in 5 major banks, 15-day approval commitment

3. **Awareness:**
   - Organize "Mill Owner Study Tour": Take 30 owners to Latur (Maharashtra) to see upgraded mills
   - Showcase economics: â‚¹60 lakh investment â†’ â‚¹25 lakh additional annual profit â†’ 2.5-year payback
   - Publish case studies: 5 early adopters share their success stories

4. **Incentive Boost:**
   - Announce: First 50 mills to complete upgradation get additional â‚¹5 lakh grant (limited-time offer)
   - Create competition: Publicly display application tracker on dashboard

*Monitoring:*
- Monthly application rate target: 25 mills/month for next 6 months
- Success criteria: 150 applications by end of Year 3 (6-month extension from original target)

*Outcome (End Year 3):*
- Applications: 165 (110% of target, exceeded!)
- Installations: 130 completed, 35 in progress
- Key factor: Study tour + case studies converted skeptics

**Scenario 3: FPO Turnover Not Meeting Targets**

*Situation (Year 4):*
- Target: 35 FPOs with average â‚¹30 cr turnover each (â‚¹1,050 cr total)
- Actual: 35 FPOs registered, but average turnover only â‚¹12 cr (â‚¹420 cr total)
- Deviation: -60% on turnover (registrations on track)

*Investigation:*
- NABARD conducts FPO financial audit
- Findings:
  - 20 FPOs: Low member participation (only 30% of members sell through FPO)
  - 10 FPOs: Lack of working capital (can't pay farmers upfront, so farmers sell to traders)
  - 5 FPOs: Poor management (CEOs lack business acumen, no marketing strategy)

*Root Cause:*
- FPO formation focused on registration numbers, not viability
- Insufficient handholding post-registration

*Corrective Actions:*

1. **Member Engagement:**
   - Mandate: Every FPO must conduct monthly member meetings (attendance tracked)
   - Bonus payment system: FPOs distribute 10% of annual profit as dividend to members (incentivizes participation)
   - Trust-building: Start with input supply (seeds, fertilizers at 10% discount), then move to output marketing

2. **Working Capital:**
   - NABARD provides â‚¹50 lakh working capital loan per FPO (3% interest)
   - Payment model: FPOs pay farmers 80% immediately, 20% after selling to buyer (reduces cash burden)

3. **Professional Management:**
   - CEO training program: 6-month intensive (IIM Bangalore executive education)
   - Hire professional marketers: Each FPO gets â‚¹3 lakh/year grant to hire a marketing manager
   - Technology adoption: Provide ERP software (free) for inventory, accounting, member tracking

4. **Buyer Linkages:**
   - Organize Buyer-FPO Meets: Invite dal mill owners, HOPCOMS, retail chains
   - Sign MoUs: Secure 3-year procurement contracts (price = MSP + 5%)
   - Quality assurance: Provide grading equipment to FPOs (ensures only quality produce sold)

*Monitoring:*
- Quarterly FPO review: Turnover, member participation %, net profit
- Red flag: If FPO turnover <â‚¹20 cr for 2 consecutive quarters, intensive support

*Outcome (Year 5):*
- Average turnover: â‚¹28 cr (93% of revised target)
- 5 FPOs: Failed, dissolved (lessons: Location matters, CEO quality critical)
- 30 FPOs: Thriving (member retention >80%)
- **Key lesson:** Registration â‰  Success, focus on business fundamentals

### 4.3 Adaptive Management Principles

#### **1. Fail Fast, Learn Faster**

*Philosophy:* Not every scheme will work. Identify failures early, pivot quickly.

*Implementation:*
- **Pilot Phase (Months 1-6 of any new scheme):**
  - Start with 10% of target (e.g., 30 mills instead of 300)
  - Intensive monitoring: Weekly reviews, daily data
  - Beneficiary feedback: Survey after 3 months
  - Go/No-Go decision after 6 months

*Example:*
- Scheme: Organic farming promotion (â‚¹100 cr over 3 years)
- Pilot: 100 farmers in 10 villages (â‚¹5 cr)
- Result: Only 30% of farmers adopted, organic yield 20% lower than conventional, no price premium achieved
- Decision: Cancel scheme, reallocate â‚¹95 cr to drip irrigation (proven success)

*Dashboard Display:*
- Schemes in "Pilot" status clearly labeled
- Outcome: "Scaled" (successful) or "Discontinued" (failed)
- Lessons learned published (transparency about failures)

#### **2. Flexibility Within Guardrails**

*Philosophy:* Empower departments to make decisions, but within boundaries.

*Guardrails:*
- Phase budget cannot exceed Â±10% without Steering Committee approval
- Physical targets can be revised Â±15% by Collector, beyond that requires State approval
- Scheme changes must not disadvantage SC/ST/women (equity check)

*Flexibility:*
- Departments can:
  - Shift budget between sub-schemes (e.g., borewells â†’ farm ponds if water table too deep)
  - Change contractors mid-way if poor performance (subject to legal process)
  - Adjust timelines by up to 3 months (if due to monsoon delays, etc.)

*Example:*
- Agriculture Dept realizes: In 3 blocks, soil is too rocky for borewells
- Proposes: Shift â‚¹50 cr from borewells â†’ Lift Irrigation Schemes (uses river water)
- Process: PMU reviews (hydraulic feasibility?), Collector approves (within Â±10% limit)
- Outcome: More effective use of funds, higher farmer satisfaction

#### **3. Evidence-Based Decision Making**

*Philosophy:* Opinions are important, but data decides.

*Practice:*
- Every major decision (>â‚¹10 cr impact) must be backed by:
  - Dashboard indicators (quantitative trends)
  - Field reports (qualitative ground truth)
  - Beneficiary surveys (voice of people)
  - Expert opinion (technical feasibility)

*Example Decision: Should we invest in Check Dams vs. Percolation Tanks?*

| Evidence Type | Check Dams | Percolation Tanks | Decision Tilt |
|---------------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Dashboard data | Existing 50 check dams: 40% siltation, low recharge | 30 tanks: 85% functional, high impact | Tanks âœ“ |
| Field reports | Contractors say: Check dams need annual de-silting (high maintenance) | Tanks: One-time construction, 25-year life | Tanks âœ“ |
| Beneficiary survey | Farmers prefer tanks (smaller, closer to their fields) | Check dams benefit only downstream farmers (equity issue) | Tanks âœ“ |
| Expert opinion (Hydrogeologist) | Check dams good for alluvial soil; Kalaburagi is mostly hard rock | Tanks: Works in hard rock, recharges aquifer faster | Tanks âœ“ |

*Decision:* Invest 70% in tanks, 30% in check dams (in alluvial-soil blocks only)

#### **4. Continuous Feedback Loops**

*Philosophy:* Monitoring is not a one-way street. Beneficiaries must have a voice.

*Mechanism 1: Dashboard Feedback Button*
- Every page has "Report an Issue" button
- Citizens can submit:
  - Data corrections ("Borewell shown as completed, but not working")
  - Grievances ("Contractor demanding bribe")
  - Suggestions ("Add a scheme for livestock insurance")
- PMU responds within 7 days (acknowledgment within 24 hours)

*Mechanism 2: Quarterly Town Halls*
- District Collector hosts public meeting (open to all, no invitation needed)
- Format: 1-hour presentation + 2 hours Q&A
- Tough questions welcome (transparency builds trust)
- Live-streamed on YouTube (archive available)

*Mechanism 3: Beneficiary Committees*
- Every major scheme (>â‚¹100 cr) has a 15-member committee:
  - 5 beneficiaries (elected by peers)
  - 5 domain experts (agriculture scientists, economists)
  - 5 officials (department, PMU, BDO)
- Meets quarterly, reviews scheme performance, proposes changes
- Recommendations published on dashboard

## PART 5: SUSTAINABILITY & EXIT STRATEGY

### 5.1 Post-2030 Institutionalization

**Vision:** By 2030, data-driven governance becomes BAU (business as usual), not a special project.

**Transition Plan:**

**Year 7 (2029):**
- PMU transitions from "project mode" to "district planning unit" (permanent establishment)
- Budget: Shift from one-time grants to regular state budget allocation
- Dashboard: Integrated into official district website (not standalone)
- Data Collection: DCO positions converted to regular government posts (Group C cadre)

**Year 8 (2030):**
- Final evaluation: "Did we achieve Rank 15?" (Celebrate if yes, honest assessment if no)
- Lessons learned: 200-page case study published (for other districts to replicate)
- Awards: Apply for national recognition (PM Award for Excellence in Public Administration)
- Knowledge transfer: Kalaburagi officials train other bottom-performing districts

**Post-2030:**
- New target: Rank 15 â†’ Top 10 by 2035 (continuous improvement)
- Dashboard evolves: Add new indicators (SDGs, climate resilience, ease of doing business)
- Financing: Self-sustaining through improved revenue (GST collections, property tax)

### 5.2 Risk Register & Mitigation

#### **Top 10 Risks (Prioritized by Impact Ã— Probability)**

| # | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Prolonged drought** (3+ years) | Medium | Very High | Drought-proof investments (check dams, crop insurance), contingency fund (10%), migrate to less water-intensive crops |
| 2 | **Political instability** (govt change, priority shift) | Low | High | Multi-party buy-in, public pressure for continuity, apolitical PMU, lock-in via signed MoUs |
| 3 | **Funding shortfall** (schemes discontinued) | Medium | High | Diversify sources, front-load committed funds, build relationships with multiple financiers |
| 4 | **Data fraud** (inflated numbers) | Low | Medium | Random field verifications (20%), third-party audits, whistleblower protection, punish severely if caught |
| 5 | **Contractor cartel** (collusion, poor quality) | High | Medium | Performance bonds, blacklisting for poor quality, encourage new entrants, community monitoring |
| 6 | **Migration to Bangalore despite jobs** (cultural reasons) | Medium | Medium | Showcase success stories, improve urban amenities in Kalaburagi, wage parity with Bangalore |
| 7 | **Technology failure** (dashboard crashes) | Low | Low | Cloud hosting (99.9% uptime), backup systems, test under high load, incident response plan |
| 8 | **Beneficiary fatigue** (survey overload) | Medium | Low | Limit surveys to 10% sample, incentivize participation (â‚¹200 voucher), respect farmers' time |
| 9 | **Interdepartmental conflict** (ego clashes) | High | Low | Collector's leadership, clear protocols, neutral PMU as mediator, performance incentives for collaboration |
| 10 | **COVID-like pandemic** (project delays) | Low | Medium | Remote work protocols, digital signatures, contactless disbursements, prioritize essential schemes |

**Industry-Specific Risks (4 Additional):**

| # | Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| 11 | **PM MITRA funding lapse** (Garments MoU delay) | 30% | Critical | Fast-track land acquisition (THIS MONTH), DC weekly monitoring, CM-level escalation, MoU signing by March 31, 2026 |
| 12 | **Mining lease delays** (Limestone 24-36 months) | 60% | High | Parallel applications (5 sites), political support, fast-track requests, legal firepower (₹15L), quarterly CM follow-up |
| 13 | **AS9100 certification failure** (Aerospace quality) | 40% | Critical | Hire world-class consultant (₹30L/year), build quality from Day 1, mock audits quarterly, German partnership (₹5cr) |
| 14 | **Pharma City Phase 2 delays** (Market disappears) | 40% | High | Diversify: Bangalore (15%), exports (30%), other cities (10%), early MoUs with 3 companies, WHO-GMP certification |

## CONCLUSION

This framework transforms the â‚¹15,500 crore investment roadmap from an aspirational document into an **executable program**. Success requires:

1. **Political will** (District Collector's leadership, CM's support)
2. **Institutional discipline** (Weekly reviews, data integrity, accountability)
3. **Technical rigor** (Evidence-based decisions, course corrections)
4. **Community participation** (Beneficiaries as co-creators, not just recipients)
5. **Transparency** (Public dashboard, honest reporting, admitting failures)

The dashboard is not just a monitoring tool. It is a **contract between the government and the people** of Kalaburagi. Every number on that dashboard represents a promise: to lift 28.40 lakh people from rank 30 to top 15, to create 156,700 jobs (100K core + 56.7K industries), to establish 4 new industrial sectors, to ensure that no child has to migrate to Bangalore just to survive.

This is a generational project. Let's execute it with the urgency it deserves.
