## Critical Role in Framework v2.0 (2026-2034)

### **THE LAND USE CRISIS**

**Framework Challenge:** ₹20,150 cr investment across 4 major industrial clusters requires coordinated land use planning, zoning amendments, and rapid approvals.

**Current Reality:** KUDA Master Plan 2041 prepared before Framework v2.0 → does not adequately zone for:
- 300 acres PM MITRA Textile Park
- 500 acres Aerospace Cluster (Sedam expansion)
- 200 acres Pharma Zone
- 250 acres Limestone processing units
- 8,000 worker hostel beds in mixed-use zones

**TPO's Critical Actions Required:**
1. Emergency Master Plan amendments for industrial zones (2026-27)
2. Fast-track approval process for Framework projects
3. Rezone 1,250 acres total for 4 industrial clusters
4. Plan 3 worker housing zones near industrial areas

## Worker Housing Crisis → TPO's Critical Role

**Framework Reality:** 156,700 new jobs by 2034 → At least 40,000 migrant workers from other districts/states → Need 8,000-10,000 hostel beds + 5,000 affordable rental housing units.

**Current KUDA Master Plan:** Does not have designated "Worker Housing Zones" → Result: Workers will live in slums or illegal settlements → Social problems, poor living conditions, industrial productivity suffers.

**TPO's Solution: Create 3 Worker Housing Zones**

### Zone 1: PM MITRA Worker Zone (Sedam/Chittapur)
- **Capacity:** 3,000 hostel beds + 1,500 affordable rental units
- **Zoning:** Mixed-Use Residential-Commercial (MURC)
- **FAR:** 2.5 (higher than normal 1.5 to allow 6-8 story dormitories)
- **Amenities:** Shops, clinics, bus stand, banks, post office
- **Distance from Textile Park:** 3-5 km (cycling/bus distance)

**TPO Actions:**
- Notify 150-acre MURC zone by Q1 2027
- Relax building regulations for dormitory construction (shared toilets, kitchens allowed)
- Fast-track building approvals for KHB and private developers

### Zone 2: Sedam Industrial Area Worker Zone (Aerospace + Pharma)
- **Capacity:** 2,500 beds + 2,000 rental units
- **Zoning:** Skilled Worker Housing Zone (higher quality)
- **FAR:** 2.0
- **Housing Mix:** 60% dormitories for factory workers, 40% 1-2 BHK for skilled workers/supervisors

### Zone 3: Limestone Belt Worker Colony
- **Capacity:** 2,000 beds (basic dormitories)
- **Location:** Chincholi area, away from mining dust
- **Zoning:** Industrial Worker Housing
- **FAR:** 1.8

## Infrastructure Coordination for Industries

### 1. Road Network Master Plan Amendments

**Critical Need:** 45 km approach roads to industrial areas need widening/upgrades

**TPO Actions:**
- **Amend Master Plan:** Upgrade 45 km roads from 2-lane (15m) to 4-lane (30m)
- **Land Acquisition:** Coordinate with Revenue Dept for road widening (15m additional width)
- **Alignment Planning:** Avoid residential demolitions (choose agricultural land routes)
- **Freight Corridors:** Designate heavy vehicle routes (limestone trucks, container lorries)

**Key Routes:**
1. **NH-9 to PM MITRA Park:** 12 km (currently 2-lane, need 4-lane)
2. **Kalaburagi City to Sedam IA:** 18 km (upgrade)
3. **Sedam to Aerospace Cluster:** 8 km (new road)
4. **Chincholi to Cement Zone:** 15 km (heavy vehicle road)

**Budget Estimate:** ₹125 cr (coordinate with PWD)

### 2. Water Supply Planning

**Industrial Demand:** 10 MLD additional water by 2030

**TPO Actions:**
- **Zoning for Water Infrastructure:** Reserve land for:
  - Water treatment plants (5 acres each, 3 locations)
  - Overhead tanks (2 acres each, 5 locations)
  - Pipeline routes (20m width corridors)
- **Coordinate with KUWSDB:** Ensure industrial zones have water supply master plan

### 3. Drainage & Sewerage

**TPO Actions:**
- **CETP Location:** Zone 50 acres for Common Effluent Treatment Plant (pharma + textile)
- **Drainage Master Plan:** Storm water drains for industrial areas (prevent flooding during monsoon)
- **Sewerage Network:** Extend city sewerage to worker housing zones

## Approval Process Reforms for Framework v2.0

**Current Problem:** Building approval takes 90-120 days → Industries frustrated, delays in investment.

**TPO's Fast-Track System:**

### 1. Framework v2.0 Single-Window Cell
- **Dedicated Officer:** Assign 1 TPO exclusively for Framework projects
- **Pre-Approved Layouts:** Standardize factory layouts (garments, aerospace, pharma) → Auto-approval if layout matches
- **30-Day Approval Target:** From application to building permit

### 2. Digital Approval System
- **Online Submission:** All documents uploaded (no physical visit needed)
- **Auto-Scrutiny:** Software checks FAR, setbacks, height compliance
- **Parallel Processing:** Fire NOC, Pollution NOC, Water NOC processed simultaneously (not sequentially)

### 3. Deemed Approval
- **45-Day Rule:** If TPO doesn't respond in 45 days → Approval automatically granted
- **Liability:** TPO responsible for post-approval inspections

---

## Success Metrics (2026-2034)

### Land Use Targets
- **Industrial Zone Expansion:** 12% → 18% of urban area by 2030
- **Worker Housing Zones:** Notify 375 acres (3 zones) by 2027
- **Mixed-Use Development:** 25% of new residential areas as mixed-use by 2029

### Approval Efficiency
- **Average Approval Time:** 90 days → 30 days by 2027
- **Framework Projects:** 100% approved within 45 days (fast-track)
- **Digital Adoption:** 80% applications submitted online by 2028

### Infrastructure Readiness

### With State Departments
- **KIADB:** Industrial area development, layout approvals
- **PWD:** Road construction, widening projects (₹125 cr budget)
- **KUWSDB:** Water supply master planning
- **KSPCB:** Pollution control, CETP planning
- **Fire & Emergency:** Fire NOCs, safety compliance

## Challenges Specific to Kalaburagi

1. **Agricultural Land Conversion:** Farmers resist conversion → Need DC's intervention, fair compensation
2. **Water Scarcity:** Drought-prone region → Industrial water demand vs agricultural needs (political sensitivity)
3. **Forest Overlaps:** Limestone belt has reserved forests → Clearances take 2-3 years
4. **Fragmented Land Holdings:** Small farmers (2-5 acres each) → Difficult to assemble 300-500 acre parcels
5. **Political Pressure:** Land use changes face opposition from local MLAs/corporators → Need state govt backing

---

## Budget & Resources

### Current KUDA Budget (Approximate)
- **Plan Preparation:** ₹5 cr/year
- **Development Control:** ₹3 cr/year (staff, inspections)
- **Enforcement:** ₹2 cr/year

### Framework v2.0 Requirements
- **Master Plan Amendment:** ₹8 cr (consultant fees, surveys, public hearings)
- **Digital Approval System:** ₹5 cr (software, training)
- **Fast-Track Cell:** ₹3 cr/year (dedicated staff)
- **Land Surveys:** ₹10 cr (1,250 acres industrial + 375 acres worker housing)
