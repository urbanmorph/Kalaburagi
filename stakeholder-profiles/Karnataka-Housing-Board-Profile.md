## 3. ROLE IN EMPLOYEE HOUSING FOR INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS

### 3.1 Relevance to Kalaburagi Industrial Development

| Industry | Employment Target | Housing Requirement | KHB Role |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Garments (PM MITRA)** | 26,000 jobs | ~8,000-10,000 units | EWS/LIG housing near industrial zone |
| **Aerospace Components** | 12,000 jobs | ~4,000-5,000 units | MIG housing for skilled workers |
| **Pharma Packaging** | 6,700 jobs | ~2,200-2,500 units | LIG/MIG housing |
| **Limestone/Cement** | 12,000 jobs | ~4,000 units | EWS/LIG housing |
| **TOTAL** | 56,700 jobs | ~18,000-22,000 units | Mixed housing clusters |

### 3.2 SAFE Accommodation Framework

**National Initiative:** Site Adjacent Factory Employee (SAFE) Accommodation
- Convened by NITI Aayog (August 2024)
- Addresses critical shortage of workers' accommodation near industrial areas
- Karnataka participated alongside Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, UP

**Key Findings:**
- Lack of housing drives workforce attrition
- Lowers productivity
- Undermines manufacturing competitiveness

### 3.3 KHB Projects Near Industrial Areas

**Devanahalli Project (772 acres):**
- Near Information Technology Investment Region (ITIR)
- Focus on affordable housing for technology/industrial workers
- 50-50 land sharing model (landowners receive developed land instead of cash)

**Kempegowda International Airport Integrated Township:**
- 65 acres at Chikkajala-Meenukunte village
- Residential + commercial for airport/industrial workforce

### 3.4 Coordination with KIADB

**Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB):**
- Established under KIAD Act, 1966
- 173 industrial areas across 30 districts
- Provides land for industries, NOT housing

**Coordination Model:**
```
KIADB → Industrial Land Development
   ↓
KHB → Employee Housing Near Industrial Areas
   ↓
Municipal Bodies → Long-term Maintenance
```

**Integration Required for Kalaburagi:**
- PM MITRA site requires adjacent affordable housing
- Aerospace/Pharma units need skilled worker housing
- Coordinated planning between KIADB and KHB essential
