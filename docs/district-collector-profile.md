```

### 6.4 Karnataka-Specific Reform Context

**Historical Note:** Karnataka conducted a notable experiment (1987-1992) where District Collectors were made subordinate to elected Zilla Parishad chiefs. This did not result in governance failures, demonstrating potential for greater democratic control of district administration.

**Current Model:** While PRIs have constitutional authority, the DC maintains a central coordinating role for state and central government programs while respecting PRI autonomy in their mandated areas.

## 7. Dashboard Design Implications

### 7.1 Primary User Needs

| Need | Dashboard Feature |
|------|------------------|
| **Quick situation awareness** | Executive summary with traffic-light indicators |
| **Actionable alerts** | Priority-sorted alerts with clear deadlines and actions |
| **Multi-scheme visibility** | Consolidated view across DISHA schemes |
| **Drill-down capability** | From district summary to taluk/GP level |
| **Historical trends** | Progress tracking over time |
| **Comparative benchmarks** | Performance vs. other districts, state average |

### 7.2 Critical Alert Categories

Based on DC responsibilities, alerts should cover:

1. **Deadline-driven** (fund lapse, scheme closure, license expiry)
2. **Performance-driven** (KPI below threshold, target slippage)
3. **Compliance-driven** (audit observations, court orders)
4. **Crisis-driven** (disaster, law & order, public health)
5. **Stakeholder-driven** (investor grievance, R&R complaint, public petition)

### 7.3 Recommended Dashboard Sections

1. **Command Center** (Real-time alerts, key metrics)
2. **Development Progress** (Phase-wise implementation tracking)
3. **Financial Dashboard** (Fund flow, credit disbursement, expenditure)
4. **Infrastructure Status** (Projects, clearances, milestones)
5. **Employment & Livelihoods** (Jobs created, skill training, migration)
6. **Grievance Tracker** (Investor, citizen, departmental complaints)
7. **Data Quality Indicators** (Source reliability, update frequency)

### 7.4 Data Confidence Framework

| Confidence Level | Criteria | Dashboard Treatment |
|-----------------|----------|-------------------|
| **High (Green)** | Official source, <6 months old, verified | Display as-is |
| **Medium (Yellow)** | Official source, 6-24 months old, or survey-based | Show with caveat |
| **Low (Red)** | >24 months old, or single-source estimate | Flag prominently |
